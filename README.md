echo "# Network Intrusion Detection Model

This project implements a machine learning model for network intrusion detection using the CICIDS2017 dataset. The model is designed to classify network traffic into multiple categories of cyber attacks and benign activity, helping to identify and mitigate potential security threats in real time.

## Overview

The system utilizes a Random Forest classifier trained on various network traffic features extracted from packet capture data. It processes input network flow data and predicts the type of attack or benign traffic.

## Supported Attack Categories

- BENIGN (Normal traffic)
- DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)
- DoS GoldenEye
- DoS Hulk
- DoS Slowhttptest
- DoS slowloris
- Heartbleed
- PortScan
- Web Attack – Brute Force
- Web Attack – SQL Injection
- Web Attack – XSS

## Features

- Preprocessing and cleaning of network traffic data
- Encoding of categorical labels for model training
- Handling of infinite and missing values to maintain data integrity
- Prediction based on carefully selected network traffic features
- Easy integration with external systems for real-time traffic classification

## Usage

The model is loaded from a serialized file and accepts network traffic features as input to generate predictions about the nature of the traffic. The output is a label indicating the detected type of network activity.

## Dataset

The training data is derived from the CICIDS2017 dataset, which contains realistic and labeled network traffic, including various attack scenarios and benign behavior.
